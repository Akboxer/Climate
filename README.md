<h1>CLIMATE DATA ETL DATA PIPELINE </h1>
In this project we have collected climate data from a third party platform using api . In this api we just define a city name and the we got the climate data of that city.
(the current day data and some upcoming days ).
Then we transformed the dataset according to our need . For this we used numpy , pandas .
Then we loaded that data to our sql server database table .
We also made a chat that simply analysis temperature  data of a city.
